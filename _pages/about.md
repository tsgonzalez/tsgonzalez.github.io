<p>
  I’m a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.ml.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Machine Learning Department</a> at Carnegie Mellon University, 
  co-advised by <a href="https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/" target="_blank">Aaditya Ramdas</a> and 
  <a href="https://gfanti.github.io/" target="_blank">Giulia Fanti</a>, and a member of the 
  <a href="http://statml.cs.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">StatML group</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I’m broadly interested in the algorithmic and statistical aspects of modern machine learning. I work on problems that I find both practically relevant 
  and intellectually challenging, with research spanning areas such as optimization and generative modeling,
  primarily under differential privacy constraints.

Previously, I obtained my MSc from the [Institute for Mathematical and Computational Engineering](https://imc.uc.cl/) at the Catholic University of Chile, advised by [Cristobal Guzman](https://sites.google.com/view/cguzman/). I was also a Student Researcher at Google working with [Courtney Paquette](https://cypaquette.github.io/) and [Fabian Pedregosa](https://fa.bianp.net/pages/about.html).
