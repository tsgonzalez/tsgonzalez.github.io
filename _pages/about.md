I’m a PhD student in the [Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University, where I'm co-advised by [Aaditya Ramdas](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/) and [Giulia Fanti](https://gfanti.github.io/). I’m broadly interested in the algorithmic and statistical aspects of modern machine learning. I work on problems that I find practically relevant and intellectually challenging, approaching them from computational and statistical perspectives. My research spans areas such as optimization, generative modeling, and aggregation for collective decision making, primarily under differential privacy constraints. I draw on ideas from mathematical statistics and theoretical computer science to provide strong theoretical guarantees.

Previously, I obtained my MSc in Engineering from the [Institute for Mathematical and Computational Engineering](https://imc.uc.cl/) of the Catholic University of Chile, under the supervision of [Cristobal Guzman](https://sites.google.com/view/cguzman/). In 2022-23, I was a Student Researcher at Google Deepmind working with [Courtney Paquette](https://cypaquette.github.io/) and [Fabian Pedregosa](https://fa.bianp.net/pages/about.html).
