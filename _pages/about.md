I’m a PhD student in the [Machine Learning Department]([https://duckduckgo.com](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/)) at Carnegie Mellon University, where I'm co-advised by [Aaditya Ramdas](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/) and [Giulia Fanti](https://gfanti.github.io/). Previously, I obtained my MSc in Engineering from the [Institute for Mathematical and Computational Engineering](https://imc.uc.cl/) of the Catholic University of Chile, under the supervision of [Cristobal Guzman](https://sites.google.com/view/cguzman/). Before that, I was an undergraduate at the same institution. 

In 2022-23, I was a Student Researcher at Google Deepmind working with [Courtney Paquette](https://cypaquette.github.io/) and [Fabian Pedregosa](https://fa.bianp.net/pages/about.html).

<h1>Research</h1>

I’m interested in theoretical aspects of machine learning. My current research areas include stochastic optimization and privacy-preserving ML.
